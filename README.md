# `HopeSpeechDetectionEACL2021`
## My  work on hope speech detection task under EACL2021.
In this tasks I have used various pretrained transformer models for transfer learning as well as cross lingual inferencing .
The dataset is pretty imbalanced .
The models used are:
i) IndicBERT
ii) mBERT
iii) XLM-Roberta
